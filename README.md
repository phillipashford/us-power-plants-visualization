# A Snapshot of US Power Plant Fuel Sources

Welcome! **This project features an interactive map and data visualization of power plants across the United States**. Users can toggle between **renewable and non-renewable energy sources** to see which areas of the country rely on each type of energy.

The map is built using **Leaflet**, an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. The data is sourced from a [geoJSON file](https://github.com/phillipashford/us-power-plants-visualization/blob/main/data/power-plants.js), which provides information about power plant locations, fuel sources, and energy output. The plants are symbolized using circle markers with a radius based on their energy output. Users can click on each marker to learn more about the power plant's fuel sources and energy output.

The "Renewables" and "Non-Renewables" buttons allow users to filter the map by energy source. The renewable category includes sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, while the non-renewable category includes coal, natural gas, petroleum, and nuclear power. You can use the buttons to toggle back and forth between the two categories. **Some plants fall in both categories and subsequently show up in both layers.**

Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy exploring the data!
