# A Snapshot of US Power Plant Fuel Sources

Welcome! **This project features an interactive map and data visualization of US Electrical Supply**. It displays information on the location and fuel sources of power plants across the United States. By clicking on a specific location on the map, users can access a popup containing details on the plant's name, fuel source(s), and distance from the selected location.

The map is built using **Leaflet**, a widely-used open-source **JavaScript library** for interactive maps.The data is sourced from a [geoJSON file](https://github.com/phillipashford/us-power-plants-visualization/blob/main/data/power-plants.js), which provides information about power plant locations, fuel sources, and energy output. 

- The plants are symbolized using circle markers with a radius based on their energy output.
- Users can click on each marker to learn more about the power plant's fuel sources and energy output.
- The layer control UI element allows users to filter the map by energy source.
- The stats section displays a pie chart of power generation by fuel source within 500 km of the selected location, along with a breakdown of total power generation in the area of interest by fuel source.

The combination of the interactive map and detailed data visualization makes this webpage an excellent tool for exploring and understanding the complex network of power plants in the United States. Its sophisticated **data analysis and visualization** tools are useful for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in energy trends and
patterns across the country.

Thank you for visiting. I hope you enjoy exploring the data!
